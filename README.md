Algorithm used Dijkstra
This repository contains a Java implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, which is used to find the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. This particular implementation allows users to input the names of places (nodes), the distances between them (edges), and the starting place point. The algorithm then computes and displays the shortest paths and distances using the names of the places.

-Features
Accepts user input for the number of places and their names.
Accepts a distance matrix representing the distances between each pair of places.
Computes the shortest path from a specified starting place to all other places using Dijkstra's algorithm.
Displays the shortest path and distance for each place using their names for better readability.
